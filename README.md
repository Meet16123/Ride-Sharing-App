# Uber-Like Ride Booking Application

This project is a **scalable ride-booking application** similar to Uber, built using **Spring Boot**. It supports **real-time ride requests, driver matching, payment processing, and authentication**. The system is designed for high availability, security, and performance.

## ðŸš€ Key Highlights
- **Optimized Geospatial Queries**: Utilizes **PostGIS** in PostgreSQL to calculate distances between riders and drivers efficiently, enhancing the ride-matching process.
- **Secure Authentication**: Implements **Spring Security with JWT** for robust **user authentication and role-based authorization**, ensuring data security.
- **Scalable Microservices Architecture**: Designed for **high availability** with separate services for user management, ride requests, payments, and driver management.
- **Cloud Deployment**: Deployed on **AWS** using **RDS, Elastic Beanstalk, and EC2**, with **automated CI/CD pipelines through AWS CodePipeline**.
- **Robust Testing**: Achieves **high test coverage** with **JUnit and Mockito**, ensuring reliability across critical system features.
